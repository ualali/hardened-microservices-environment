How will you test the changes?
A sandbox environmet will be used to test changes to the cluster. This will protect production systems from being interrupted or corrupted.
This is good practice that we can implement as part of our deployment strategy and Software Development Lifecycle.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
Using our sandbox environmet we will tests changes so we can monitor and observe the impact of those changes.
Once changes are deployed to the sandbox environmet, we can monitor metrics using Prometheus and Grafana.
Also, we can collect logs and traces to determine the root cause of problems and troubleshoot more eficiently.
Historical observability in the form of a changelog will be used to construct a continuous changelog that allows us not only
to understand historical events, but also to trace how historical changes impact the current state of our cluster.
Our overall focus will be on the state of our cluster as a whole, and not in individual components in isolation to gain a full
overview of our cluster.
